# Amazon Product Recommender System

This is a capstone project for a Data Science major accompanied by code files and a paper.
I built a product recommender system using collaborative filtering and content-based techniques, trained on Amazon product review datasets. Throughout this 3-month project, I also got the chance to get my feet wet in the field of Recommender Systems and explore a variety of methods people have used in practice and industry.
